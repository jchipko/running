# Summary

In this project, I visualize my personal running/walking data from the Apple Health app and use data visualization to answer the following questions:

- On average, how far did I run/walk each day during this time period?
- Which days of the week was I the most active on?
- Am I less active during certain months in the year?

Due to limitations with Github, the plots aren't displayed in the notebook above. See [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jchipko/running/blob/master/Running%20Analysis.ipynb) instead to view the plots.
