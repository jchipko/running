# Summary

In this project, I visualize my personal running/walking data from the Apple Health app and use data visualization to answer the following questions:

- On average, how far did I run/walk each day during this time period?
- Which days of the week was I the most active on?
- Am I less active during certain months in the year?

## Summary of Results

From my work below, I confirmed that I walked between 2 and 5 miles daily, except during the winter months. I was much less active November - March, probably due to colder weather, except when I was travelling. Finally, I was most active on Tuesdays and Saturdays according to this data, but it should be noted that the data excludes any activity performed when I wasn't carrying my phone.
